Collection of react snippets I use, supporting both JavaScript and TypeScript. I use these over the many pre-existing extensions because those generally clog up VS Code with tons of snippets i would never use.

## How To Add Snippets

- Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P)
- Type "Configure User Snippets" and select it
- Choose "New Global Snippets file..."
- Name your snippets file whatever you'd like
- Copy and paste the snippets into the newly created file
